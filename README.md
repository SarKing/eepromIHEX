# eepromIHEX

Takes data from a CSV file and formats it to IHEX. This file is then ready to be uploaded into an avr eeprom using avrdude.

## Installation

For installing, clone this repository to your computer, enter in the folder
eepromIHEX and type "make", then "make install" as root.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/SarKing/eepromIHEX
$ cd eepromIHEX
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

By default it's installed in /opt/eepromIHEX

#### Unistall

If you want to uninstall the application enter with your terminal in the folder
that you downloaded and type:

```bash
$ sudo make uninstall
```

## Usage

The basic use of this application just requires a CSV data file.

```bash
$ eepromIHEX data_file
```
And it will generate a file called "a.eep" that contains your data formatted to IHEX.

But you have more customization in the form of arguments.

#### Arguments

    -output             -o      The name of the output file. DEFAULT: a.eep
    --datalenght        -d      Maximum number of bytes per IHEX entry. DEFAULT: 32 
    --address           -a      The first address you want to write to. DEFAULT: 0
    --verbose           -v      Prints verbose information
    --help              -h      Prints help page
    --version                   Displays the version message

#### Examples

Get data from data.csv, output IHEX formatted data to eeprom.eep
```bash
$ eepromIHEX -o eeprom.eep data.csv
```

Format IHEX with 8 byte data length instead of the default 16
```bash
$ eepromIHEX -d 8 data.csv
```

Start writing to eeprom address 0xFF instead of the default 0
```bash
$ eepromIHEX -a 255 data.csv
```

#### CSV File
The CSV file used as data source needs to be like this
```bash
00,FF,5D,6E44,62,86,72,D2,55,12,22,4F,FF,00,00,00,23,45,63,56
```
It causes no problem if two or more commas are together, like this
```bash
00,FF,,6E44,62,86,,,55,12,22,,,,,00,23,45,63,56
```
But by no means can be data more than 1 byte long, so this is prohibited and will cause a malfunction
```bash
00,FFF,545D,6E44,62,86,72FF,D2,55,12,22,4F,FF,00,00,00,23,45,63,56
```

## Uploading

Once you have the .eep file, for uploading it to a AVR microcontroller using
avrdude you have to use this command.
```bash
$ avrdudde -c programmer -p mmcu -U eeprom:w:filename:i
```
Where filename is the .eep file you just generated
